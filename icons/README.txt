Place your app icons here:

Required for best results:
- icon.ico  (Windows, contains 16/32/48/64/128/256 sizes)
- icon-192.png  (PWA)
- icon-512.png  (PWA)

Quick options:
1) Convert a 512x512 PNG to ICO using an online converter and save as icons/icon.ico.
2) For PWA, export 192x192 and 512x512 PNGs as icon-192.png and icon-512.png.

Until these are added, builds will still run, but installer/app may show a default icon.
